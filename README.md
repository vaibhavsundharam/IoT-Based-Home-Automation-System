# IoT-Based-Home-Automation-System

This is a simple project that incorporates IoT using BOLT microcontroller to enable home automation. In the code I have provided with a way to turn an AC bulb "ON" or "OFF".

If you wish to incorporate more peripheral devices, simply add a bigger relay and give the excitation to the relay coil accordingly.
